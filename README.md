# Bird CLI Project Readme

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Bird CLI project! This command-line interface (CLI) is tailored for birders who want a tool to explore information about birds and recent bird sightings. The project adopts a microservices architecture, and integrates with a custom microservice.

## Project Components

### 1. Project

#### Objective
Design and implement a CLI that empowers users to:
- Play Bird Pop Quiz Game
- Generate random bird names
- Generate recent bird sightings at a location (latitude, longitude)
- Exit the interface

#### User Interface
Command-line interface (CLI)

#### Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Plan and implement the initial version of the project with a UI.
- **Milestone 4:** Polish the project for inclusion in portfolio.

### 2. Microservice

#### Objective
Create a microservice intended for use in the project. This microservice adeptly handles requests related to bird data.

#### Functions
- Generate a randomly selected common bird name from the eBird API.
- Retrieve recent bird sightings at a given latitude and longitude from eBird API.

#### Milestones
- **Milestone 2:** Plan and implement the microservice.
- **Milestone 3:** Integrate the project with the microservice.

## Project Progression

- **Week 1:** Acquaint oneself with the microservices architecture through a programming assignment.
- **Week 2:** Establish the project environment and plan Sprint 1.
- **Week 3:** Design the user interface for the project.
- **Weeks 4+5 (Sprint 1):** Dive deeper into microservices, implement the project (Milestone #1), and plan Sprint 2.
- **Weeks 6+7 (Sprint 2):** Implement the microservice Milestone #2) and plan Sprint 3.
- **Weeks 8+9 (Sprint 3):** Seamlessly integrate projects with microservices (Milestone #3).
- **Week 10:** Finalize the project (Milestone #4).

## Environment Considerations

Collaborate with a partner to decide on the running environment for the projects:

- **Option 1. No web:** Projects run locally without web technologies.
- **Option 2. Web:** Projects hosted on a public web server.
- **Option 3. Mix-and-match:** Find a compatible combination of running environments.

## Project Requirements

Ensure the project aligns with the following requirements:

- The individual project must incorporate the microservice.
- Both projects must feature a user interface reflecting inclusivity heuristics.
- Each team member is responsible for writing all their own code.
- Interaction between projects must occur programmatically.
- Projects must run in different processes.

## Showcase Your Project (Milestone #4)

For Milestone #4:

1. **Video Demonstration:** Showcase each feature of the project, emphasizing usability, maintainability, and integration with the microservice.
2. **Self-Reflection:** Provide insights into how the course has impacted the developer.

I hope your birding experience is both informative and enjoyable!
