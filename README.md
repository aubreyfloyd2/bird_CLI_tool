# Bird CLI Project Readme

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Bird CLI project! This command-line interface (CLI) is tailored for birders who want a tool to explore information about different bird species. Additionally, users can have some fun generating random bird names. The project adopts a microservices architecture, where the individual project collaborates with a microservice created by a partner.

## Project Components

### 1. Individual Project

#### Objective
Design and implement a CLI that empowers users to:
- Request information about specific bird species
- Generate random bird names
- Exit the interface

#### User Interface
Command-line interface (CLI)

#### Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Plan and implement the initial version of the individual project with a UI.
- **Milestone 4:** Polish the individual project for inclusion in the developer's portfolio.

### 2. Microservice (Partner's Part)

#### Objective
Create a microservice intended for use in the partner's individual project. This microservice should adeptly receive and respond to programmatic requests related to bird data.

#### Milestones
- **Milestone 2:** Plan and implement the microservice.
- **Milestone 3:** Integrate the individual project with the partner's microservice.

## Project Progression

- **Week 1:** Acquaint oneself with the microservices architecture through a programming assignment.
- **Week 2:** Establish the project environment and plan Sprint 1.
- **Week 3:** Design the user interface for the individual project and find a suitable partner.
- **Weeks 4+5 (Sprint 1):** Dive deeper into microservices, implement the individual project (Milestone #1), and plan Sprint 2.
- **Weeks 6+7 (Sprint 2):** Implement the microservice the partner will call (Milestone #2) and plan Sprint 3.
- **Weeks 8+9 (Sprint 3):** Seamlessly integrate individual projects with microservices (Milestone #3).
- **Week 10:** Bring the course project to completion (Milestone #4).

## Environment Considerations

Collaborate with a partner to decide on the running environment for the projects:

- **Option 1. No web:** Projects run locally without web technologies.
- **Option 2. Web:** Projects hosted on a public web server.
- **Option 3. Mix-and-match:** Find a compatible combination of running environments.

## Project Requirements

Ensure the project aligns with the following requirements:

- The individual project must incorporate the partner's microservice.
- Both projects must feature a user interface reflecting inclusivity heuristics.
- Each team member is responsible for writing all their own code.
- Interaction between projects must occur programmatically.
- Projects must run in different processes.

## Showcase Your Project (Milestone #4)

For Milestone #4, submit:

1. **Video Demonstration:** Showcase each feature of the individual project, emphasizing usability, maintainability, and integration with the partner's microservice.
2. **Self-Reflection:** Provide insights into how the course has impacted the developer.

I hope your birding experience is both informative and enjoyable!
